Notes extracted for context
FastHTML is a python library which brings together Starlette, Uvicorn, HTMX, and fastcore&#39;s `FT` "FastTags"
into a library for creating server-rendered hypermedia applications. The `FastHTML` class itself
inherits from `Starlette`, and adds decorator-based routing with many additions, Beforeware,
automatic `FT` to HTML rendering, and much more.'>Things to remember when writing FastHTML apps:

- Although parts of its API are inspired by FastAPI, it is *not* compatible with FastAPI syntax and is not targeted at creating API services
- FastHTML includes support for Pico CSS and the fastlite sqlite library, although using both are optional; sqlalchemy can be used directly or via the fastsql library, and any CSS framework can be used. Support for the Surreal and css-scope-inline libraries are also included, but both are optional
- FastHTML is compatible with JS-native web components and any vanilla JS library, but not with React, Vue, or Svelte
- Use `serve()` for running uvicorn (`if __name__ == "__main__"` is not needed since it's automatic)
- When a title is needed with a response, use `Titled`; note that that already wraps children in `Container`, and already includes both the meta title as well as the H1 element.<docs><doc title="FastHTML quick start" desc="A brief overview of many FastHTML features"># Web Devs Quickstart
